# HC-SR04 Sensor
One of the most useful sensors we have is the ultrasonic distance sensor.  This simple sensor may be used in a variety of ways with our mobile robot platforms.  

## Step One: Build the Circuit

This simple diagram allows us to use the sensor:

## Step Two: Write the code

Use the [starter code here](https://github.com/WHS-Robotics-Classes/HC-SR04_Sensor/blob/main/HC-SR04_demo.ino) in the repository to get the sensor working.
